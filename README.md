# Blog with React & Markdown
---
Welcome to **Blog React Markdown Based** – a sleek and modern blog application built using React and Markdown! This project is **my personal take** on the fantastic tutorial provided by [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) in their repository [smooth-toc-example](https://github.com/craftzdog/smooth-toc-example) and their insightful YouTube video: [Create a Blog with Smooth TOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g26x6FzuBU).

## 🌟 Features

- **React-Powered**: Enjoy a fast and interactive user experience with React.
- **Smooth TOC Integration**: A table of contents that enhances navigation, inspired by the tutorial.
- **Custom Enhancements**: My personal tweaks and improvements based on the tutorial.
